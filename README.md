# Sound-Space-Multi-Tool

This program contains many converters and miscellaneous other tools for automating tasks such as randomizing or speeding up maps or turning Clone Hero timing points into OSU timing points.

Please report any bugs you may come across if you do decide to download this tool for yourself. My Discord is Avibah#6449 if you wish to contact me there. You can also suggest things to me there.
